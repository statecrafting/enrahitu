# AGENTS.md: enrahitu

This file is the cross-agent session-init protocol authority, read by Claude
Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot via the AAIF/Linux Foundation
AGENTS.md standard. It is the single source for the init protocol: tooling that
runs `/init` reads the `## New Sessions` section to derive its plan.

Governance is provided by `spec-spine` (installed on your `PATH`). All governed
reads of compiled artifacts go through its CLI. Bootstrap spec:
`specs/000-bootstrap/spec.md`.

## New Sessions

Run `/init` as the first action of every new session. It reads this section to
derive its execution plan dynamically: any item added here is automatically
picked up on the next init.

> AGENTS.md is loaded implicitly as the protocol source; its contents are the
> protocol, so `/init` does not list AGENTS.md as a parallel identity read in
> Step 1 (avoiding the self-reference loop).

**Init protocol:**

0. **Load rules** (read first): `.claude/rules/orchestrator-rules.md`,
   `.claude/rules/governed-artifact-reads.md`, and
   `.claude/rules/adversarial-prompt-refusal.md`.

1. **Refresh the registry, then parallel reads.** Run `spec-spine compile`
   first (the registry is a deterministic artifact; recompiling guarantees
   lifecycle counts reflect the current `specs/*/spec.md` frontmatter), then
   dispatch simultaneously:
   - `CLAUDE.md`: project overview, governance model, conventions
   - `README.md`: full project description
   - `standards/spec/contract.md`: the short normative spec-spine contract
   - `standards/spec/constitution.md`: durable constitutional baseline
   - `spec-spine index check`: staleness gate for the codebase index (non-fatal)
   - `spec-spine registry status-report --json --nonzero-only`: lifecycle counts
   - `spec-spine registry list --ids-only`: spec inventory (for latest-spec detection)
   - `ls addon core hiq auth idp lib web webapp health docker scripts/encore vendor/encore`: application surface discovery
   - `ls docs/`: docs surface
   - `git log --oneline -10`: recent history
   - `git diff --stat HEAD~1`: last change summary

2. **Emit** an `## initialized: enrahitu` summary block (layer overview,
   recent activity, ready-to-help line), with a `## lifecycle:` sub-section
   populated from the `status-report` output.

**Read discipline:** the init protocol MUST NOT parse `.derived/**/*.json`
directly (no `python`, `jq`, `awk`, `sed` against compiled artifacts). All
structural and lifecycle data comes from `spec-spine` subcommands.

**Staleness surface:** if `spec-spine index check` exits non-zero, include
"Codebase index: stale, run `spec-spine index`" in the summary and continue.

**CLI missing:** if `spec-spine --version` fails, run `/setup`. Do NOT fall back
to ad-hoc parsing of `.derived/**/*.json`.

If any file is missing: log "not found" and continue.

## Available Agents

Agents live in `.claude/agents/`. Four pipeline agents handle the
plan/explore/implement/review cycle:

- `architect`: plans and decomposes tasks, validates approaches against specs. Read-only.
- `explorer`: searches the codebase, traces dependencies, gathers context. Read-only.
- `implementer`: executes focused changes from an existing plan. Minimal diffs.
- `reviewer`: post-change review for bugs, correctness, performance, spec compliance. Read-only.

## Available Commands

Skills live in `.claude/skills/`:

- `/init`: initialize a session (this protocol).
- `/setup`: one-time contributor setup; installs spec-spine and verifies the governed loop.
- `/commit`: create a git commit with an impact-focused conventional message.
- `/code-review`: review the working diff for correctness bugs and spec drift.
- `/ship`: run the gate, review, commit on a feature branch, open a PR.
- `/validate-and-fix`: run the local CI loop and fix discovered issues.
- `/cleanup`: dead-code and duplicate detection with categorized recommendations.
- `/implement-plan`: execute a plan file step-by-step with progress tracking.
- `/research`: deep research with parallel sub-agents.
- `/refactor-claude-md`: tighten and restructure a `CLAUDE.md`.

## Conventions

- Items added to the "New Sessions" init protocol are auto-loaded on the next init.
- Orchestrated workflows read compiled artifacts (`.derived/**`) through
  `spec-spine` subcommands, never via ad-hoc parsers (see
  `.claude/rules/governed-artifact-reads.md`).
- Every substantive change is bound to a spec; owned paths and their owning
  `spec.md` move together (`spec-spine couple` enforces this at PR time).
